Migration Guide
===============

pa11y's API changes between major versions. This is a guide to help you make the switch when this happens.

Migrating from 2.0 to 3.0
-------------------------

### API Overhaul

The pa11y JavaScript API has been overhauled completely. It would be best to refer to the [usage guide in the README](README.md#usage) as your code will need refactoring.

### Randomized Ports

The `phantom.port` option no longer has a default. If a port is not specified, then pa11y will bind to an available port. This allows for easier running of tests in parallel, as PhantomJS instances will no longer conflict with eachother.

### Node.js Support

Node.js 0.10 is no longer officially supported, pa11y is unlikely to continue to work with this version going forward.


Migrating from 1.0 to 2.0
-------------------------

### Command-Line Interface

The command-line interface in 2.0 is similar to 1.0, but there are a few key changes.

  - The `console` reporter has been renamed to `cli` and has a different output format
  - The `csv` reporter now includes the message context and selector
  - The `json` reporter now outputs an array which matches the new [output format](#output-format). You can use the [pa11y JSON 1.0 reporter](https://github.com/springernature/pa11y-reporter-1.0-json) to output 1.0-style JSON
  - Reporters no longer handle the way pa11y exits, this is controlled through the new `--level` flag
  - Custom reporters now have a different API, see the [README](README.md) for more information
  - The file specified by the `--config` flag now expects JSON in a different format. See [configuration](#configuration)
  - The `--htmlcs` flag shorthand has been changed to `-H`
  - The `--useragent` flag has been removed, this is now managed through the config file
  - The `--viewport` flag has been removed, this is now managed through the config file
  - The `--strict` flag has been removed, this is controlled through the new `--level` flag
  - HTML CodeSniffer is now loaded from a local file by default so tests can be run offline

### JavaScript Interface

A two-step running process is now used over a single `pa11y.sniff()` function. This allows a single PhantomJS browser to run multiple tests, reducing memory usage and making pa11y more usful to derivative tools. See the [README](README.md) for more information.

### Output Format

Results in pa11y 2.0 are no longer output as an object, instead only the results array is provided. It's up to your code (or reporter) to add totals etc. Also the result format has been changed:

```js
// 1.0 result
{
  code: 'WCAG2AA.Principle2.Guideline2_4.2_4_2.H25.2',
  message: 'Check that the title element describes the document.',
  type: 'notice',
  html: '<title>Pa11y - Your automated accessib...</title>'
}

// 2.0 result
{
    code: 'WCAG2AA.Principle2.Guideline2_4.2_4_2.H25.2',
    context: '<title>Pa11y - Your automated accessib...</title>',
    message: 'Check that the title element describes the document.',
    selector: 'html > head > title',
    type: 'notice',
    typeCode: 3
}
```

### Configuration

Configuration options have had a big overhaul between 1.0 and 2.0:

  - The `url` option has been removed. See [JavaScript Interface](#javascript-interface) for more information
  - The `config` option has been removed. Cookies are now set as in the `page.headers` option. Ignored rules are now set in a new `ignore` option
  - The `ignore` option now accepts message types (error, warning, notice) as well as codes
  - The `useragent` option has been removed, it can now be set in the `page.headers` option
  - The `port` option has been removed, it can now be set in the `phantom.port` option
  - The `viewport` option has been removed, it can now be set in the `page.viewport` option
  - The `debug` option has been removed, debugging is now handled by the `log.debug` option which expects a function

### Contributing/Testing

pa11y 2.0 uses Make over Grunt as a build tool. For Windows users, all of the Make targets should be runnable individually by copying commands from the Makefile and running within a terminal.
